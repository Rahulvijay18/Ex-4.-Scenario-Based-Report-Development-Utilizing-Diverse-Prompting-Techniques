## 1. Introduction

Customer experience is one of the most crucial factors in retail. With the rise of AI-powered chatbots, businesses are leveraging natural language processing (NLP) models to deliver real-time customer support. However, the effectiveness of chatbots depends heavily on how prompts are engineered.

Prompt engineering is the art of crafting inputs that guide AI models to generate the most relevant, accurate, and user-friendly outputs. By applying various prompting techniques (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, role-based, etc.), we can design an adaptive chatbot that handles different customer scenarios efficiently.

This report provides a comprehensive 10-page deep dive into the design, methodology, experiment, analysis, and comparison of chatbot performance using prompting techniques.

## 2. Background on Prompting Techniques

| Technique              | Description                                                                | Advantages                             | Limitations                          |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Zero-shot Prompting    | Model is given a task without prior examples.                              | Quick, no dataset needed.              | Accuracy may drop for complex tasks. |
| Few-shot Prompting     | Model is given 2–5 examples before the actual task.                        | Improves accuracy for domain tasks.    | Requires curated examples.           |
| Chain-of-Thought (CoT) | Model is guided to explain reasoning step-by-step before the final answer. | Strong for reasoning & problem solving | Can be verbose, slower.              |
| Role-based Prompting   | Model is assigned a persona (e.g., “Customer Support Agent”).              | Human-like, consistent tone            | May overfit to role.                 |
| Instruction-tuned      | Prompts are given as direct instructions.                                  | Clear format adherence                 | Requires strict phrasing.            |
| RAG (Retrieval-Aug.)   | Model retrieves documents before answering.                                | High factual accuracy                  | Needs infra (retrieval setup)        |

## 3. Retail Chatbot Scenario Design

The chatbot will serve a retail store that sells electronics and clothing. It should handle:

* Order tracking (“Where is my package?”)
* Product inquiries (“Does this laptop support Windows 11?”)
* Customer complaints (“I received a damaged product.”)
* Return/refund requests (“How do I return this item?”)

### Use Case Diagram (Textual Representation)

Actors:

* Customer
* AI Chatbot
* Retail Database / Inventory System
* Customer Support Staff (fallback escalation)

## 5. Experiment Setup

* Dataset: Retail FAQs, order tracking logs, and synthetic customer queries.
* Prompts tested: Zero-shot, Few-shot, CoT, Role-based, Instruction-tuned, RAG.
* Evaluation Metrics:

  * Accuracy of response
  * Customer satisfaction score (1–5)
  * Task completion rate (%)
  * Latency (response time)

### Sample Prompts

**Zero-shot**
Q: Where is my order #4567?

**Few-shot**
Example 1: Q: Where is order #1234? A: Delivered on 2025-09-02
Example 2: Q: Where is order #5678? A: In transit, expected 2025-09-10
Now answer: Q: Where is order #4567?

**Chain-of-Thought**
Step 1: Identify intent (order tracking).
Step 2: Query order #4567 in database.
Step 3: Return delivery status.

**Role-based**
“You are a polite retail support agent. Greet the customer, check order #4567, and respond professionally.”

**Instruction-tuned**
“Look up order #4567 in the database. If shipped, return expected date. If delivered, return confirmation.”

**RAG**
“Retrieve order #4567 from database. Summarize: {status, delivery date}.”
